# Gitlet Design Document

**Name**:Qiu Wenqiang

The main functionality that Gitlet supports is:
1. Saving the contents of entire directories of files. In Gitlet, this is called committing, 
   and the saved contents themselves are called commits.

2. Restoring a version of one or more files or entire commits. In Gitlet, this is called 
   checking out those files or that commit.

3. Viewing the history of your backups. In Gitlet, you view this history in something 
   called the log.

4. Maintaining related sequences of commits, called branches.

5. Merging changes made in one branch into another.


## Classes and Data Structures

### Repository
This is the main logic of Gitlet will live. This file will handle all the 
actual Gitlet commands by reading/writing from/to the correct file, 
setting up persistence and additional error checking.

It will also be responsible for setting up all persistence within Gitlet. 
This includes creating the `.gitlet` folder as well as folder and file where 
we will store `Commit` objects and other metadata.

#### Fields
1. `public static final File CWD = new File(System.getProperty("user.dir"));`
   The Current Working Directory. Since it has the package-private access modifier
   (i.e. no access modifier), other classes in the package may use this field. It 
   is useful for the other `File` objects we need to use.

2. `public static final File GITLET_DIR = join(CWD, ".gitlet");`
   The hidden `.gitlet` directory. This is where all the state of `Repository`
   will be stored. It is also package-private as other classes will use it to 
   store their state.

3. `public static final File HEAD = join(GITLET_DIR, "HEAD");` 
   The file contains persistence data of the front of current branch of Gitlet.

4. `public static final File INDEX = join(GITLET_DIR, "INDEX");`
   The file contains persistence data of the staging area.

5. `public static final File COMMIT_DIR = join(GITLET_DIR, "commits");`
   The folder holds the file of persistence data of Commit objects.

6. `public static final File BLOB_DIR = join(GITLET_DIR, "blobs");`
   The folder holds the file of persistence data of Blob objects.

7. `public static final File TREE = join(GITLET_DIR, "TREE");`
   The file containing the persistence data of commit tree.

8. `public static final File CONFIG = join(GITLET_DIR, "CONFIG");`
   Configure file where info of remote repos are saved

9. `private static Tree tree;`
   An instantiated object of class Tree to manage Commit objects.

10. `private static StagingArea stagingArea;`
   An instantiated object of class StagingArea to manage added info and removed info.

11. `private static RemoteRepo repo;`
   An instantiated object of class RemoteRepo containing info of the added remote repo.


### StagingArea
This is a place containing staged files(for addition or removal) after command `add` 
and command `rm`.

#### Fields
1. `private HashMap<String, String> addition;` 
   For the files to be added.

2. `private HashMap<String, String> removal;` 
   For the files to be removed.

### Commit
The saved contents of entire directories of files. `Commit` is a combination of 
log messages, other metadata (date, message...), a reference of the current tree, 
and references to parent commits.

#### Fields
1. `private String message;` 
   annotation of the current commit.

2. `private Date timestamp;` 
   date when Commit object is constructed.

3. `private TreeMap<String, String> map;` 
   a map of file names to references to their class Blob objects.

4. `private String parentRef;` 
   a parent reference

5. `private String secondParentRef;` 
   second parent reference(for merges)

6. `private String commitRef;`
   The reference of current Commit object, an SHA-1 value produced by using 
   the metadata(combination of only timestamp and log message), the mapping of names 
   to references, and the parent reference.


### Blob
The `Blob` class is where contents of files are saved. A single file might 
correspond to multiple blobs: each being tracked in a different `commit`.

#### Fields
1. `private String fileName;` 
   The file name in the working directory.

2. `private String content;` 
   The saved content of a file.

3. `private String blobRef;`
   The Reference of a class Blob object and filename of the file in local repo.


### Tree
Directory structures mapping names to reference to blob and other trees(subdirectories).

#### Fields
1. `private String head;`
   The reference to the front of the active branch.

2. `private TreeMap<String, String> branches;`
   All branches and the references to their own front commit(branchName : headRef)

3. `private String activeBranch;`
   The active branch name.


### Utils
This class contains helpful utility methods to read/write objects or String 
contents from/to files, as well as reporting errors when they occur.

This is a staff-provided and PNH written class, so we leave the actual 
implementation as magic and simply read the helpful javadoc comments above each 
method to give us an idea of whether itâ€™ll be useful for us.

#### Fields
Only some private fields to aid in the magic.

### SHA1
This class will create a unique string of SHA-1 value according to the input strings. 

### Date
This class 

## Algorithms

### class Repository
1. `public static void init()`
   Initialize all directory structure of .gitlet;
   Initialize all static variables in class Repository and complete their data persistence;
   Complete first commit with message "initial commit" and add it to the tree;

2. `public static void add(String fileName)`
   Add the file name and its reference to the staging area if it is not 
   tracked in the head of current branch.

3. `public static void commit(String message)`
   Create a new commit. The commit will get the same snapshot from the head of current branch which will become
   the parent of the commit. Add all staged files to the commit and delete all removed
   files from the commit if their exist. Add the commit to the current branch and the commit
   become the new head of current branch.
   
4. `public static void checkout(String doubleDash, String fileName)`
   checkout -- fileName
   Check the existence of the file in the head of current branch. 
   Read the file from the head commit and write the file to the working directory.

5. `public static void checkout(String commitRef, String doubleDash, String fileName)`
   checkout commitID -- fileName
   Check the existence of the target commit. Check the existence of the target file in that commit.
   Read the file from the commit and write it to the working directory.
   
6. `public static void checkout(String branchName)`
   checkout branchName
   Check the existence of the branch. Write all files in the head of the branch to the
   working directory, remove all files that are untracked by the head.
   
7. `public static void rm(String fileName)`
8. `public static void log()`
9. `public static void globalLog()`
10. `public static void find(String commitMessage)`

## Persistence
### Directory Structure
````
CWD/
   - .gitlet/ -- top level folder for all persistence data
      - blobs/ -- folder for persistence data of Blob objects
         - blob1 -- a single Blob object stored to a file
         - blob2
         - ...
         - blobN
      - commits/ -- folder for persistence data of Commit objects
         - subdiretory1/ -- folder name is first six characters of SHA-1 ref of commit object
            - commit1 -- file name is the rest charaters of SHA-1 ref of the commit object
         - subdiretory2/
            - commit2
         ...
         - subdiretoryN/
            - commitN
      - HEAD -- the front of current branch of Gitlet
      - INDEX -- file containing persistence data of Staging Area
      - TREE -- file containing persistence data of commit tree
      - config - file recording name and location of remote repo
   - testing/ -- simultation as a remote hub
      - remote directory/ -- remote repo
         - .gitlet/
            ...
````

### IO
The `Repository` class will set up all persistence. It will: 
1. Create `.gitlet` folder if it doesn't exist.
2. Create `blobs` folder if it doesn't exist.
3. Create `commits` folder if it doesn't exist.
4. Create `HEAD` file if it doesn't exist.
5. Create `INDEX` file if it doesn't exist.

### Class Blob
The `Blob` class will handle the serialization of `Blob` objects.
1. `public void readFromOriginalFile();` Read the contents of the file in CWD using 
   `Utils.readContentAsString()` method.

2. `public void writeToOriginalFile();`  Write `this.content` to the file in CWD 
   named `.gitlet/blobs/this.fileID`

3. `public void readFromBlobFile();` Read from the file named `.gitlet/blobs/this.fileID` 
   and convert it into `Blob` object using `Utils.readObject();` method.

4. `public void writeToBlobFile();` Write an entire `Blob` object into the file 
   named `.gitlet/blobs/this.fileID` using `Utils.writeObject()` method.
   (Actually, blob file is not allowed to be modified, so the calling of the function 
   is just only one time.)

### Class Commit
The `Commit` class will handle the serialization of `Commit` objects.
1. `public void readFromFile();` Read from the file `join(COMMIT_DIR, fileID)`
   and convert the data into `Commit` object using `Utils.readObject()` method.

2. `public void writeToFile();` Write `this` to the file `join(COMMIT_DIR, fileID)`
   using `Utils.writeObject()` method.
   
The `StagingArea` class will handle the serialization of `StagingArea` objects.
1. `public void readFromFile();` Read from the file `.gitlet/INDEX` and convert 
   the data into `StagingArea` object using `Utils.readObject()` method.
   
2. `public void writeToFile();` Write `this` to the file `.gitlet/INDEX` using 
   `Utils.writeObject()` method.

### Class StagingArea`
1. `public void readFromFile()`
   Check out the existence of file `Repository.INDEX`, if not, return;
   Read object from file `Repository.INDEX` by `Utils.h::readObject()` method 
   and update member variables `addition` and `removal` of current object.

2. `public void writeToFile()`
   Write current object into file `Repository.INDEX` created if not exist by `Utils.h::writeObject()` method.
